Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. To contribute a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, please consider adding tests.
3. If you've modified existing code, please state the reason and update the documentation.
4. Match the existing code style (roughly Google C++ Style Guide).
5. Submit the pull request with the details of your feature/fix!

## Please report bugs using Github Issues
This is the easiest way to track bugs and discuss fixes (e.g. if the code needs a patch, or if there's an issue with documentation, etc.). Report bugs by [opening an issue](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues).

## Remember to write bug reports with detail, background, and an example of the issue
Please provide enough information so that the error could be reproduced!

Ideally, the report should have:
- Summary/background of the bug
- Detailed information on your setup steps
    - Information to reproduce the bug
- Expected output, and actual output
- Any information about what you think might be going wrong
